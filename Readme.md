# Basic Blockchain in Go
This project is a simple implementation of a blockchain in Go, created for educational purposes. It demonstrates the fundamental concepts of blockchain technology, including:
* **Blocks:**  Data structures containing transactions, timestamps, and hashes.
* **Blockchain:** A chain of blocks linked cryptographically.
* **Mining:**  A basic Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism to add new blocks.
* **Immutability:**  Demonstration of how tampering with a block invalidates the chain.
* **Merkle Tree:**  Implementation for efficient data integrity and proof verification.

## Features
* **Mine New Blocks:** Add new blocks to the blockchain with user-provided data.
* **View Blockchain:** Display the contents of the entire blockchain.
* **Tamper with Blocks:**  Simulate data modification in a block and observe the chain invalidation.
* **Check Blockchain Validity:** Verify the integrity of the blockchain.
* **Merkle Tree Test:**  Create and test a Merkle Tree with sample data, including proof generation and verification.

### Prerequisites
* **Go:** Make sure you have Go installed on your system. You can download it from [https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/).
